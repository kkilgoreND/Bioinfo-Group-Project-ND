-Search resticted to Mouse-

discontinuous MegaBlast
- looks for longer matches therefore has less 'hits' (for example transcript 2 has 44 hits compared to the 123 
hits from using Blastn) (146 vs 169 transcript 6) (262 vs 295 transcript 8)

-Accounts for genomes that have gapped alignments. Thus aligning sequences containing regions that don't have a match to the query sequence but still match portions of the query. Would probably be best on different species instead of the same type of species(i.e. mouse/Mus).

Blastn
- many more hits found here -- not as specific sequences are included

- another indication of the less specific results given from a Blastn search is the E value accepted values. 
For example the highest E value found under a discontinuous MegaBlast is 1.2 while 4.2 is found under the 
Blastn E values for transcript 8.
