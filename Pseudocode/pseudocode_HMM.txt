#pseudocode for the Hidden Markov Model

1) do a loop for muscle alignments for each of the 6 transcripts from the downloaded protein sequences

2) do a HMM build in a loop using the new alignments and 6 

3) do a HMM search using the HMMbuild files and the fasta files containing sequences to be searched


## further development of code

1)

for i in *ref
do
../muscle3.8.31_i86win32.exe -in $i -out $i.align
done

2)

for i in *.align
do
../hmmer-3.1b2-cygwin64/binaries/hmmbuild.exe $i.hmm $i
done

3)

for i in *fasta
do
../hmmer-3.1b2-cygwin64/binaries/hmmsearch.exe --tblout $i.hits (all .hmm files) $i
done
