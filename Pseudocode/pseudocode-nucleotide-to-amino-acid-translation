1) Import packages
	A) numpy, pandas, re, scipy
2) Import codon table as a dataframe
3) Import fasta files as dataframes; include an output file for each of the input fasta files. These will be the translated sequences.
	For example...
	control1=open("control1.fasta","r+")
	control1amino=open("control1amino.fasta","w")
4) Strip the first lines of their carat, akin to what we have done before in class
	
5) For loop to complete the following...
	for nucleotides in allFastaFiles
