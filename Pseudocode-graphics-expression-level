1) Import packages, including numpy, pandas, scipy, and plotnine

2) Establish RNAseq files as a dataframes (control1.fasta=1, 
control2.fasta=2, obese1.fasta=3, and obese2.fasta=4)

3) From the dataframes, write a ggplot script for a violin graph 
with the following conditions...
	a) Points on the x axis belong to the transcript names (x=[1], for example)
	b) The y axis spans a numerical range based on the number of transcripts
	c) The dataframes are all plotted on one graph, with each dataframe having a separate color
The violin graph should accomodate the entire range of transcript 
levels per each transcript, while allowing for all transcripts to be 
readily discernable.

ggplot(data=dataframes1-4, aes(x=transcriptNames, 
y=transcriptLevels))+geom_violin(scale="area" and any additional details to make the violins easy to read)+color(red for df1, blue for df2, green for df3, 
black for df4)+theme_classic()
