For the results from the Obese1 sequence file, using mammalian sequences as a reference for the HMMbuild and HMMsearch, the following can be determined...

Atp12a returned an e-value of 0
Gsta2 returned an e-value of 1.9e-130
Lhx2 and Ptpn5 did not return any hits
Slc7a12 returned an e-value of 2.3e-291
Synpr returned an e-value of 5.2e-190

Total hit counts were as follows...

Atp12a     38
Gsta2      2
Lhx2       0
Ptpn5      0
Slc7a12    16
Synpr      100

For the results from the Obese1 sequence file, using nonmammalian sequences as a reference for the HMMbuild and HMMsearch, the following can be determined...

Atp12a returned an e-value of 0
Gsta2 returned an e-value of 7.7e-128
Lhx2 and Ptpn5 did not return any hits
Slc7a12 returned an e-value of 8.1e-87
Synpr returned an e-value of 8.4e-183

Total hit counts remained unchanged, however. Thus, in examining the differences between the e-value returns, including nonmammalian sequences in building HMM models was 
detrimental in the cases of Gsta2, Slc7a12, and Synpr. While it was not enough to cause differences in returned hit counts, it is almost certain that, for other proteins, 
hit counts would be affected.
