No “issues” but good comments with the commits

The scripts supplied work with one exception. Exercise3.py throws an 
invalid syntax error at line 83. The equals sign and the less than sign 
are in the wrong order. Placing them in reverse, less than sign then the 
equals sign, fixes the script.



The Part3.py and Part3_v2.py scripts do not throw any error messages, 
but they were hung up by my processor for five minutes.



Q1P2.py is a very efficient code and worked great!




When writing pseudocode, can be more helpful to add more detail – not necessarily actual syntax, but each individual step of a function could be laid out, i.e. what does this part do, here’s where I set up my variables, here’s where I write an equation, etc. See pseudocode for Question 3 for comparison.

As far as I can see in Question 1 Part 1, the alternative hypothesis never gets called again? So I’m not really sure how you’re testing the differences between your alternative and your null hypothesis to determine if there’s a treatment effect?

Also, your null hypothesis doesn’t look any different from your alternative hypothesis? See Question 1 Part 2 in comparison.
